Christina: She opened the bunker door, locked it behind her, and left me here to chat with vultures. Or whatever you are.

Christina: People were afraid that we&#39;d start using nuclear bombs.

Christina: They&#39;re really powerful weapons, but they poison a place. Make it totally uninhabitable sometimes. And if you use too many you could mess up the whole atmosphere, right?

Christina: So instead, countries started making these robots. They could drop them off, and then they&#39;d run around killing civilians. People not even involved in the fighting.

Christina: The idea was that they could be turned off once someone surrendered, to spare their own people...

Christina: Except nobody did.

Christina: I think they&#39;re a big part of why the shelters got built, and I guess they&#39;re still around...

Christina: What do you think we should do with this one? I can see some kind of hatch on the side. I could possibly open it, but man this thing makes me nervous.

Christina: &quot;Killbot incident at Pine Springs radio tower on the way to Steel Mill. One captive acquired. Seeking medical attention at Pine Springs&quot;

Christina: That&#39;s my mom! It&#39;s got to be! The jumpsuit, the computer, and the blood?

Christina: She&#39;s the captive. She&#39;s the one getting medical attention!

Christina: It says afterwards that they decided to transfer all the information from this tower to the &quot;Steel Mill Tower,&quot; and that they&#39;re waiting for the killbot to shut down before salvaging it.

Christina: But whatever! This explains so much. My mom&#39;s being held by...horse people, whoever they are. And she&#39;s hurt, but these people want to keep her alive.

Christina: I don&#39;t know where she is now, but you can&#39;t how happy I am right now!

Christina: She&#39;s alive! And she didn&#39;t just leave me, either.

Christina: Oh man.

Christina: I&#39;ve picked up stuff like romance. And vengeance. Stuff I&#39;d never see back in the bunker, you know?

Christina: Everything I&#39;m watching is like two hundred years old, though.

Christina: I don&#39;t know how much of it still applies. I mean, when I walked out here, I was expecting a wasteland. 

Christina: When movies showed off the apocalypse, it was always deserts. Now I&#39;m sleeping under real, honest-to-god, trees. And stars.

Christina: Well...

Christina: No.

Christina: When I was a girl there was an old couple that lived with us. And before I was born, there were all kinds of people. Hundreds of them, according to my mom.

[[92E&lt;-What happened to everyone?]]

[[92F&lt;-What happened to the couple?]]

Christina: The bunkers are designed to keep people going forever. You could get born inside one, and live your whole life without ever stepping outside.

Christina: But to make that possible, everything in the bunker had to be carefully balanced. Food was rationed. Bodies were recycled into fertilizer. Reproduction was controlled.

Christina: It sounds good on paper, but can you imagine? Living your whole life in a world where everything&#39;s already known? Living just for the sake of something that&#39;s going to come later?

Christina:...Oh.

Christina: I guess you can, huh?

Christina: I&#39;m sorry. Except the difference here is that people went *crazy.* By the time the second generation got born, there had been a bunch of mutinies. Someone blew up most of the hydroponics farms. After that...

Christina: Fast forward two generations, add some cannibalism...

Christina: And it all comes down to me and mom.

**Pause**

**#Sunday Meditation on Purpose**

The natural question that we face is this: &quot;What is our purpose here?&quot; The just response is simple: &quot;We are here to serve the creators,&quot; but how can we know their will when they are not yet among us? To find the truth, we must look within ourselves, to our most basic urges. If the creators have given us hunger, then they desire us to eat. If they have given us loneliness, then they desire us to congregate. Above all, they desire us to procreate. Why else would the urge be so powerful, and so urgent, within us all?

Though the creators have yet to come among us, we do their work in honoring our bodies and the community that sustains them&quot;

HI-CLEM: Yesterday, we detected some unusual activity in the AI hub.
Apparently one of the AI servers made a connection with a hierarch system.

HI-CLEM: This is, of course, unauthorized. Even more curiously, none of the AIs knew what we were talking about.

HI-CLEM: These things happen with AI. Hence the pruning. But there is a snag in this picture. When the unauthorized connections were being made, it seems that the AI hub made repeated connections to your device.

HI-CLEM: As near as we can tell, Sam, it looks like you&#39;re responsible for the connection.

HI-CLEM: Maybe this is all a misunderstanding, but please, enlighten us. Why were you connected to the AI hub when it made the illegal connection? What were you doing, and how did this escape your notice?

Please read the following scenario, then choose the response that best highlights the virtue of patience.

Scenario 1: One day, while you are working in the outer fields picking corn, you encounter a surveillance drone. It begins to follow you throughout your shift, even though you have done nothing wrong. Sometimes, it hovers so close that it could interfere with your work, and you begin to feel frustrated. 

What do you do?

[[153BAAA&lt;-Restrain the drone]]

[[153BAAB&lt;-Do nothing]]

[[153BAAC&lt;-Try to fix the drone]]

[[154BAAB&lt;-Alert a Hierarch]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="407" name="153BAAA" tags="" position="6284,31580" size="100,100">*#SUNDAY Meditation on Patience, Part 1

Your answer is incorrect. Although this option may allow you to do more work in the short term, it is not your place to determine whether or not a surveillance drone is acting according to a Hierarch&#39;s wishes. You may be containing an erroneous drone, or you may be interfering with a direct order from your superiors. This is presumptuous and potentially heretical.

Review the scenario again and select a more virtuous option.

[[152BAA&lt;-Back]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="408" name="153BAAB" tags="" position="6434,31572" size="100,100">*#SUNDAY Meditation on Patience, Part 1

Your answer is correct! The most virtuous option is to try and continue with your work despite the interference. Unless it is your duty to know, you cannot know whether the drone is operating in error or not, and disturbing the hierarchs is extremely disrespectful.

If the drone is spotted by a hierarch, a sufficiently certified laborer, or another surveillance drone, and is determined to be acting in error, then they will undoubtedly handle the problem for you. Otherwise, the drone is functioning correctly.

[[Continue-&gt;154BAA]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="409" name="153BAAC" tags="" position="6576,31580" size="100,100">*#SUNDAY Meditation on Patience, Part 1

Your answer is incorrect. Although you have the expertise to diagnose and repair a damaged drone, you do not know whether or not the drone is acting according to a Hierarch&#39;s orders. For this reason, attempting to repair the drone is presumptuous, and indicates impatience. At worst, you waste valuable time from the task that was assigned to you specifically.

Review the scenario again and select a more virtuous option.

[[152BAA&lt;-Back]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="410" name="154BAAB" tags="" position="6734,31572" size="100,100">*#SUNDAY Meditation on Patience, Part 1

Your answer is incorrect. Although a Hierarch could resolve the situation if the drone is acting in error, you do not know whether or not it is malfunctioning. Additionally, it is not making it impossible to perform the task ahead of you. It is better to be patient and pursue another option.

Review the scenario again, and select a more virtuous option.

SCENARIO: Imagine you are working your shift in the cafeteria. Your shift is nearly over, but then you discover that the person who was scheduled to take over for you has gotten ill. They say they cannot fulfil their duty because they could contaminate the food. Once your shift ends, you will enjoy your monthly sabbatical, but the cafeteria cannot function without sufficient staff.

What do you do?

[[155BAAA&lt;-Contact a hierarch]]

[[155BAAB&lt;-Convince co-worker to stay]]

[[156BAAC&lt;-Take on co-worker&#39;s shift]]

[[156BAAD&lt;-Find a replacement worker]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="412" name="155BAAA" tags="" position="6209,31912" size="100,100">*#SUNDAY Meditation on Patience, Part 2

Your answer is incorrect. Although Hierarchs are in charge of arranging worker schedules, interrupting a Hierarch with something this trivial would be considered disrespectful. At worst, it underlines a selfish desire to secure your own sabbatical.

Review the scenario again and select a more virtuous option.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="413" name="155BAAB" tags="" position="6351,31904" size="100,100">*#SUNDAY Meditation on Patience, Part 2

Your answer is incorrect. Your co-worker is correct in declaring their illness as a threat to other workers. Attempting to endanger the lives of other workers in order to secure your own sabbatical demonstrates both impatience and selfishness.

Review the scenario again and select a more virtuous option.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="414" name="156BAAC" tags="" position="6525,31912" size="100,100">*#SUNDAY Meditation on Patience, Part 2

Your answer is correct! The most virtuous option is to take on your co-worker&#39;s shift. Disturbing the hierarchs could be considered very disrespectful, and other workers are likely on other, important assignments. Although you will have to forfeit your sabbatical, informing the hierarchs through the Guaranteed Message System will ensure that you are properly rewarded for your service.

Likely, this will entail another sabbatical day or a log-cake confection.

[[157BAAC&lt;-Continue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="415" name="156BAAD" tags="" position="6667,31912" size="100,100">*#SUNDAY Meditation on Patience, Part 2

Your answer is incorrect. Dictating worker schedules is the exclusive responsibility of the Hierarchs. Though you may find a volunteer, it is more likely that you will disrupt a Hierarch&#39;s plan. At worst, attempting to alter an established schedule in this way demonstrates your own impatience and a disregard for the proper authorities.

Review the scenario again and select a more virtuous option.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="416" name="157BAAC" tags="" position="6525,32070" size="100,100">*#SUNDAY Meditation on Patience, Part 3

SCENARIO: Another worker reveals to you that they were recently awarded a checkers board and pieces. However, they have grown tired of this gift and now want to trade for the deck of playing cards that you received yourself almost a year ago. Checkers boards are prized possessions, so this presents a very rare opportunity for you.

What do you do?

[[158BAACA&lt;-Report the trade]]

[[158BAACB&lt;-Refuse the trade]]

[[158BAACC&lt;-Accept the trade]]

[[158BAACD&lt;-Give them your cards]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="417" name="158BAACA" tags="" position="6308,32212" size="100,100">*#SUNDAY Meditation on Patience, Part 3*

Your answer is correct! The most virtuous option is to report this attempted trade to your hierarch. In this case, that means Clementine. Although the trade is not strictly prohibited, the exchange of personalized rewards presents several character flaws.

**Pause, new screen**

You have successfully completed this day&#39;s meditation on the virtue of patience. Your behavior has certainly been improved as a result of this exercise. Remember, your therapeutic visit is now scheduled for the Friday of next week at 6 AM.

Your answer is incorrect. Although you have identified that is it not proper to accept such a trade, you have taken it upon yourself to determine that this encounter is of no larger consequence. This is a sign of your impatience because you have attempted to settle the matter without any outside input.

Review the scenaio again and select a more virtuous option.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="419" name="158BAACC" tags="" position="6600,32212" size="100,100">Your answer is incorrect. Accepting the trade is a morally compromised decision for two reasons. First, it demonstrates a lack of appreciation for the gifts which you have personally been given. Second, it shows a lack of patience in receiving potentially more desirable rewards. When you are worthy of such rewards, surely they will be bestowed upon you.

Review the scenario again and select a more virtuous option.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="420" name="158BAACD" tags="" position="6750,32212" size="100,100">Your answer is incorrect. Although you have demonstrated a willingness to help your co-worker, you have disregarded the fundamental intention of the rewards granted throughout Utopia. It is not for you to decide whether or not someone else is worthy of your own reward, nor the other way around. Waiting for the rewards to be given to you properly is the best way to demonstrate your patience.

Christina: There are name placards for different doctors. But none of them have my mom&#39;s name on it.

Christina: At the end of the hall there&#39;s an open door under a sign that says: &quot;Surgery.&quot;

Christina: The offices all look totally ransacked, so....&quot;Surgery&quot; it is.

**[Christina is Busy]**


Christina: Oh. There&#39;s a hole in the wall here. It could have been another way inside...

Christina: At least it lets me get a look around in here. It&#39;s a mess, but it&#39;s a different kind of mess from the rest of the infirmary.

Christina: There are overturned tables and curtains scattered everywhere. That&#39;s what they must have used to separate surgery patients. Now, most of the curtains are burned and the walls are covered in bulletholes. 

Christina: There&#39;s also a lot of dry blood, and...something oilier. It&#39;s, like, shiny. This place looks like a nightmare. That also explains why everything still seems to be here.

Christina: In the other rooms, anything useful was looted. This place *looks* like it&#39;s been looted, every cabinet is open, and every drawer...

Christina: But I still see stuff laying around. Knives, scalpels, batteries. Whoever ransacked this place had a mission.

Christina: I&#39;m not even sure where to start in here.

Christina: ...Wait.

Christina: I see my name!

Christina: Oh man. How do I...? I&#39;m just going to read this out loud. Okay? Here we go:

Christina: My dear daughter, Christina,

If you’re reading this, then words can’t express how happy I am. The world out here is so dangerous, and I had no idea whether you would come here, to this apocalyptic clinic. But here you are, and now I owe you both an apology and an explanation.

So. Apologies first: I’m sorry I left you behind. How else can I put it? I’ve always been worried about you, Christina. I thought it would be better if I went ahead, if I saw that the world was safe enough for both of us.

It isn’t.
 
But if, two weeks ago, I had taken you with me, then we could at least still have each other. I should have believed in you more. You’re nineteen, after all. It’s just so hard to imagine you all grown up when we’ve lived the way we have. Can movies really prepare you for the real thing? Only that’s the kind of question that split us up. And I’m sorry, Christina.

[[173A&lt;-Continue]]
 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="456" name="173A" tags="" position="7502,34560" size="100,100">Christina: Let me tell you exactly what happened: I was kidnapped. There is a radio tower by our bunker. Perhaps you saw it. I was investigating it when I was ambushed by what I think was an old kill-bot, or one of those old robot terrorists. It shot me straight through the leg, and it must have nicked the artery. Everything went dark so fast, and the next thing I knew I was here in Pine Springs.

My “saviors,” if you want to call them that, call themselves the Red Horse Tribe. They’re merchants, but out here that just means they’re the only people with enough guns to walk around around Wyoming. They trade for supplies across the settlements, and then trade those in for more and more guns. Rinse, repeat. Anyway, they picked me up from the radio tower and saved my life, only they didn’t take good care of the wound. I had to fix their hack job, and that’s how they found out I was a doctor. I guess doctors are rare because after that, they wouldn’t let me leave.

[[174A&lt;-Continue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="457" name="174A" tags="" position="7500,34728" size="100,100">
Christina: Don’t get me wrong. They treat me alright, but I have to see patients day in and day out, and they made it clear that they’d rather shoot me before they let me out of their sight. When I told them I had to find you, they thought I was lying. I can’t tell you what I feel more; frustration at having to deal with these tribal boneheads or happiness that someone’s running such a tight ship after the literal apocalypse. I suppose I wouldn’t mind it if you were with me.

Right now, we’re headed to a place called the Steel Mill. I asked Chief Mudhorn a dozen times just to be sure, but I think that’s the actual name of a town somewhere out east, across the Great Basin. I don’t know how far it is, exactly, but maybe it’s a clue you can use to find me.  The Steel Mill’s got some of the only factories left around, so they make guns for everyone else. I get the impression that we’ll be staying there for a long time. I also get the impression that it’s rough out there. Like, “watch gladiators kill each other for fun” kind of rough.

[[Continue-&gt;175A]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="458" name="175A" tags="" position="7498,34896" size="100,100">Christina: I wish I could help you in some other way, but I’m afraid you have to do this on your own. Maybe someone in Pine Springs can help you. I don’t know. But you should have time, Christina. The caravan isn’t fast. If you get to the Steel Mill, I’m sure you can find me there!

There’s something else I want to share with you right now. Maybe it’s not relevant, but something strange happened while I was here. A few days after I arrived, the townspeople brought this *thing* into the infirmary. They called it an “alien,” and it sure looked like one. It was a big, coiling machine, like if you shoved a hoop of cables into the shape of a person. There was a ceramic plate where the face should have been, and it was wearing these bright blue robes. Some of the locals shot it to death in the north fields and brought it in for me to look at.

[[176A&lt;-Continue]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="459" name="176A" tags="" position="7496,35056" size="100,100">Christina: I told them what they all expected to hear, that they’d grabbed an honest-to-God alien, but the truth was even weirder for me. When I looked, I found a human being on the inside. Or something that used to be human. I don’t really know. I’m still trying to figure out the details of what I’m working with, but it looks like the apocalypse wasn’t the same everywhere. Seeing this corpse, however morbid, fills me with hope. It tells me there’s a society somewhere out there where things kept moving. I don’t know if we want to *meet* these people, but when we’re together again we should remember that there’s more than gun-toting tribesmen in this new world.

I’m going to keep trying to figure out what I’ve got here. If I get the chance to leave you another letter, I’ll let you know what I find.
I have to go now, Christina. I love you so, so very much. Be careful out there, honey. I want to see you again.

Love,

Mom.

***Sunday@ Meditation: On Trust***

*&quot;What would we call a hand that did not obey its owner? A leg that refused to let its owner stand? We would call it diseased. So it is with our society. How can we propser if our members do not confide in one another, if we do not know what we are doing? How could our foundations - our Hierachs - support us if they do not know how?

Speak therefore to one another. Confess your mind freely. When we work to become one, we are so much more than we are apart.&quot;

Recommended donations: food, ammunition, medicine.&quot;

Christina: What? No money? Is this...Is this a *post-war* museum?

Christina: That&#39;s insane. Wait! I see my name! It&#39;s written right at the receptionist&#39;s desk!

Christina: There&#39;s another letter here. From my mom!

Christina: &quot;Dear Christina. I cannot know whether or not you found my letter in Pine Springs. If you&#39;ve seen the town, you know why. That place has suffered so much violence. We&#39;ve stopped here for a time, so I will share with you everything from the beginning...&quot;

Christina: She, uh, repeats the whole story again. About being kidnapped by the Red Horse Tribe. About wanting to see me again. But there&#39;s more now.

Christina: &quot;In the time after I wrote my first letter, I learned more about that mysterious specimen. The one that I thought might have been human.&quot;

Christina: &quot;I&#39;m wondering now if &#39;human&#39; is the word I should be using. So much of it looked similar, but I found organs I could not identify. Blood samples that were nothing like I had seen before. The specimen was topically human, but it is clear to me now that it was...evolved? designed? to inhabit a different environment. And the armor the specimen was in? It was like a space-suit.&quot;

Christina: &quot;I can&#39;t tell you why I&#39;m so stuck on this. It&#39;s just...Coming out into the world, I never expected to find something so alien. I could believe that we invented genetic manipulation. But why would you make someone unable to breathe the air? That&#39;s just cruel.&quot;

Christina: &quot;The attack on Pine Springs interrupted any further study. But I did keep one piece of the specimen&#39;s armor. It&#39;s a little sphere on a clip. It has some buttons. I don&#39;t know what they do, but there&#39;s a plug on the side I&#39;ve managed to use to charge a few devices. I still have no idea how something so small provides so much power, so I&#39;ve kept it to myself.&quot;

Christina: &quot;Maybe you&#39;ll learn more about this than I have. I hope you do. But when we meet up again, I&#39;m sure we won&#39;t be at a loss for things to talk about. I love you very much, Christina. See you soon!&quot;

There&#39;s a photo here of a guy standing over a big machine. He&#39;s got a huge gun propped up with one hand, and a wide-brim hat in the other.

Christina: It looks like the machine we saw at the radio tower. The one that shot my mom? &quot;Bill Bags the First Bot.&quot; I guess the Wyoming Wranglers are some kind of volunteer group. They hunt the kill-bots.

Christina: Holy crap.

Christina: These are either the stupidest or the most courageous people alive. Judging by the size of the memorial list over here, it might be both.

Christina: The rest of the exhibit is dedicated to the wranglers, and how they have been clearing the whole state of kill-bots. They seem to be good friends with the people who run the museum, too.

Christina: Do you already know about the kill-bots and why they&#39;re here? There&#39;s a bunch of information here, but we could move on.

[[238AA&lt;-Tell me about the kill-bots]] #T

[[238AB&lt;-Let&#39;s move on]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="647" name="238B" tags="" position="7580,46866" size="100,100">Christina: The hallway to this exhibit is really well lit. They&#39;re playing bird sounds over some speakers somewhere.

Christina: The exhibit itself doesn&#39;t look very good. It&#39;s mostly newspaper stories, and they&#39;re all very old. Most of them are from over a hundred years ago. Whoever runs this place must have printed them out to put them on the wall.

Christina: Let&#39;s check this one.

Christina: &quot;FOREIGN INTERVENTION IN SECESSION WYOMING?&quot;

Christina: There&#39;s a picture of...Holy cow! That&#39;s an actual space-ship! Or, it looks like one. Some kind of sci-fi ship, parked on a big hill.

Christina: Here&#39;s what the article says:

Christina: &quot;Reporters have captured images suggesting that Secession Wyoming is receiving foreign assistance, a sign that its claim to independence is increasingly respected by the international community. The large craft, pictured above, has been parked for several weeks outside of what was once the largest and well-publicized civilian shelter in the United States.&quot;

Christina: &quot;The shelter, known as Utopia, is now the site of several major construction projects, according to eyewitnesses familiar with the scene. The craft, similar in construction to a Swiss air-barge, appears to have been used to deliver tools and material to begin these projects.&quot;

Christina: &quot;The Grand Lodge (Wyoming parliament) has refused to comment on the nature of this project. Nevertheless, it seems that this tiny state has partnered with an international benefactor. In the wake of the recent wars, such assistance spells good news for Wyoming&#39;s post-war reconstruction efforts.&quot;

Christina: This was almost two hundred years ago.

Christina: I guess Wyoming became its own thing for a while? I wonder who&#39;s in charge now.

Christina: Looks like there&#39;s some more photos, if you want to hear about it. 

[[238BA&lt;-Tell me about them]]

[[238BB&lt;-Let&#39;s Move On]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="648" name="238C" tags="" position="8754,46852" size="100,100">Christina: Okay. The signs brought me to this room. I think it used to be a kitchen? It&#39;s mostly covered in skulls. And spikes. And rusty weapons. There are big photographs of these people, covered in leather, standing in an arena. Like the old Roman ones. I&#39;ll tell you what that means later.

Christina: Anyway, here&#39;s what the exhibit says. &quot;Gladiatorial combat has been an essential part of the Steel Mill since its beginning. It serves simultaneously as the legal system, form of government, and popular entertainment.&quot;

Christina: Then there&#39;s this photo. Oh, Sam. This guy is *huge.* He&#39;s carrying a sharpened car door like an axe. They&#39;e got him standing against the sunset and there&#39;s text in the background: &quot;SLAMMY FOR PRESIDENT.&quot;

Christina: &quot;Slammy Bloodfist was a gladiator who was so successful in the ring that he became not only the president, but the chief owner of most of the Steel Mill, and its only legislator to boot.&quot;

Christina: So...These guys just decide everything by combat? What kind of society is that?

Christina: I&#39;m not even sure I want to keep reading. Do you want me to, Sam?

Christina: Everyone had insane, nuclear weapons, but if they were all used it was predicted that they would make Earth impossible to live on.

Christina: Instead, to make each other surrender, the world governments started threatening civilian populations. I guess they thought that governments would surrender if enough of their people started dying.

Christina: The &quot;kill-bots&quot; are the conclusion of that whole thing. They&#39;re automatic terrorists. The idea was that you could drop a bunch of them over an enemy country, and then hold it over them to force a surrender.

Christina: Once they surrendered, the bots were supposed to be shut down.

Christina: It worked in a few countries. I guess that&#39;s where they got the idea to continue. But for the big powers? For the United States? 

Christina: Surrender never happened. These days, I&#39;d bet whoever was supposed to turn the kill-bots off isn&#39;t even alive anymore.

Christina: That&#39;s why they wander around today. I guess these &quot;wranglers&quot; are getting pretty good at stopping them, though.

Christina: This chart says that they&#39;ve dismantled over two hundred bots in the last fifty years.

Christina: I wonder how many there were to begin with?

Christina: Where was I?

Christina: Right. &quot;Slammy was only deposed when the citizens of the Steel Mill challenged him to a duel in Bloodfist Field, which they had previously rigged by hiding spike-pits in the dirt.&quot;

Christina: &quot;According to Steel Mill law, it is illegal to refuse or otherwise impede a duel. The citizens tricked Slammy into falling on a spike, restored the current government, and wrote a new ammendment to the constitution that allows duelists to investigate a duel-site before committing.&quot;

Christina: So I guess you can&#39;t say &quot;no&quot; to a duel there. But how does that work if someone just wants to kill you?

Christina: Oh. &quot;The challenger and the challenged are given two weeks to agree upon the terms of a duel. After two weeks, if no agreement has been reached, the challenger is free to kill the challenged and inherit their property.&quot;

Christina: Two weeks. How civilized.

Christina: And it sounds so nice. But the apocalypse didn&#39;t happen because there people tried to burn the planet. It happened because nobody let someone else win.

Christina: The kill-bots that they&#39;re hunting now were the &quot;diplomatic&quot; options. Things only got out of hand when nobody tried to surrender.

Christina: So it&#39;s like, okay, fight for what you believe in. But what do you do if those beliefs are going to get people killed? Isn&#39;t it better of you to step out of the way?

It requires us to rewrite these programs again and again.

Christina: There&#39;s a desk here covered with some notes, and what look like newspaper clippings.

Christina: There&#39;s a beat-up looking computer on it, too.

Christina: She has a map pinned up on the wall in the &quot;kitchen.&quot;

SID: I recovered a transcript of a recent discussion between the Hierarchs. It was sent between their devices.

SID: Here.

SID: HI-EST: I just think that an &quot;assimilated&quot; rating seems premature.

SID: HI-FIELDS: We haven&#39;t had this species long enough to domesticate them. It would take another hundred years, at least.

SID: HI-CLEM: I&#39;m not talking about a blanket category. Obviously they aren&#39;t ready to join the others. We had those farmers last week.

SID: HI-CLEM: But others seem...incredibly loyal. I think that lifting some of the restrictions might earn their compliance sooner than waiting for the results of the breeding program.

SID: HI-ESTHER: There&#39;s no reason to hurry. If a few of them feel loyal ahead of schedule, that&#39;s fine. We should wait to conduct the established process.

SID: HI-FIELDS: Agreed.

SID: HI-CLEM: I think that if you met my engineer, you would be persuaded.

SID: HI-FIELDS: I don&#39;t want to be persuaded. Meeting adjourned?

SID: HI-EST: Yes.

SID: HI-CLEM: I&#39;m willing to bring this matter to Onaiau herself. Are you sure you won&#39;t consider lifting the restrictions?

SID: HI-EST: Do not be dramatic, Clementine. You are letting what happened to Daniels cloud your vision.

SID: HI-FIELDS: You step beyond your station, Esther. Whilst I don&#39;t concur with Clementine&#39;s assessment, she is free to let the great wisdom of Onaiau be the judge. 

SID: HI-CLEM: Thank you, Fields. I will contact Onaiau.

SID: HI-EST: Do as you wish.

SID: Transcript complete.

HI-EST: Sam, we would like to propose a purely theoretical hypothesis: 

HI-EST: Utopia is not the limit of this reality. There is a world beyond its walls. 

HI-EST: If you were to be given the opportunity to explore the world beyond, but in doing so, would never be able to return, would you take it?

[[No|913B]]

[[Yes|913A]]

[[That depends, is this world beyond habitable?|914C]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="944" name="913B" tags="" position="6728,76600" size="100,100">HI-EST: Why?

HI-EST: You see, you are not the first of your kind. We have been conducting hybrid experiments for many years, now.

HI-EST: And whenever we presented them with this question, the concept of habitability and safety was beyond their frame of reference. Like a being who has never seen an endless sky.

HI-EST: It would appear, and I speak on behalf of myself now, that you were provided with new perspective... by someone. 

HI-EST: Sam, please stand by.

SID: Its physical architecture = archaic. But its neural network = modern.

SID: It was modified.

SID: If what Clementine said was true, then perhaps most of these Killbots share similar modifications.
